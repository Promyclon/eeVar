# eeVar
eeVar lets to define, use, read and write variables stored in AVR's EEPROM memory and configure the AVR device using data stored in EEPROM
## Variables
### Simple EEPROM variable
```C
EEPROM_VAR(var_type, var_name)
```
Defines EEPROM stored variable of type `var_type`, named `var_name` giving it a a value to be strored in EEPROM. This variable should be initialized using `EEPROM_READ()` before use.
#### Example:
```C
EEPROM_VAR(uint8_t, ledBrightness) = 127;

main()
{
  EEPROM_READ(ledBrightness);
  setPWM(ledBrightness);
}
```
### Automatic EEPROM variable
```C
EEPROM_AUTO_VAR(var_type, var_name)
```
Defines EEPROM stored variable of type `var_type`, named `var_name` with a value strored in EEPROM. This value will be automaticaly read into `var_name' in RAM in `.init8` section just before the main() function starts execution. Then, the definition alone is enough to get pre-initialized variable ready to use as soon as the program starts.
#### Example:
```C
EEPROM_AUTO_VAR(uint8_t, ledBrightness) = 127;

main()
{
  setPWM(ledBrightness);
}
```
### Read value
```C
EEPROM_READ(x)
```
Reads value of variable from EEPROM to RAM memory. This must be a variable defined with `EEPROM_VAR` or 'EEPROM_AUTO_VAR` macros.
#### Example:
```C
EEPROM_VAR(uint8_t, ledBrightness) = 127;

main()
{
  EEPROM_READ(ledBrightness);
  setPWM(ledBrightness);
}
```
### Store value
```C
EEPROM_WRITE(x)
```
Reads value of variable from EEPROM to RAM memory. This must be a variable defined with `EEPROM_VAR` or `EEPROM_AUTO_VAR` macros.
#### Example:
```C
EEPROM_AUTO_VAR(uint8_t, ledBrightness) = 127;

main()
{
  int newLedBrightness = checkButtons(ledBrightness);
  setPWM(newLedBrightness);
  if (newLedBrightness != ledBrightness)
  {
    ledBrightness= newLedBrightness;
    EEPORM_WRITE(ledBrightness); // EEPORM_WRITE(newLedBrightness) wouldn't work
  }
}
```
## Configuration
### Config set
```C
EEPROM_CONFIG(name)
```
Defines set of configuration data as a vetor filled with `EEPROM_SETUP` entries. This may be complete device initialization or partial configuration so there can be many sets in system. 
#### Note
Setting just few registers directly in code may be more efficient than using EEPROM config.
### Config entry
```C
EEPROM_SETUP(reg, value)
```
Defines register/value as a pair of configuration set.
### Using configuration
```C
EEPROM_CONFIGURE(name)
```
Rewrites configuration set from EEPROM to AVR's registers. Since it calls a function which does the job in loop the amount of used program memory does not depend on the number of entries in config data set. This technique may save some program bytes at a cost of EEPROM memory. On devices with small prghram memories it may be crucial.
#### Example:
```C
EEPORM_CONFIG(pwmEnable) =
{
  EEPROM_SETUP(PWMREG0, 1 << PWM_EN | 1 << PWM_PRESC_2),
  EEPROM_SETUP(PWMMAX, 128)
};

main()
{
  EEPROM_CONFIGURE(pwmEnable);
}
```
